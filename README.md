# Koper
 Koper is a MQ-based and event-driven distributed programming framework.
 * Koper provides a set of simplified API to implement message programming.
 * Koper supports distributed listener model and data event model.
 
# Contept 
 * Core architecture:  Message Architeture， Event Driven Architecture（EDA）
 * Core concept:       message，producer, consumer，Message Queue(MQ), topic, subscribe
 * Core component:     MessageSender, MessageListener, DataEventListener.
 * High-level concept: consumer group, message partition


# Feature
 *  A simplified set of MQ-based programming model and API.
 *  A simplified set of data event API.
  * Easy to develop asynchronous process on data event.
 *  MQ provider independent. It supports Kafka, RabbitMQ or other provider as message queue.
 *  High performance and scalability.
 *  High avalibility.
 *  High extensibility.
 *  High-level feature, time spot recording, message tracking
